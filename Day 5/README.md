### ‚öñÔ∏è Difference between For, While and Do-While Loop in Programming:

| Feature                         | while Loop                                                                            | do while Loop                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Syntax                          | while (condition) { }                                                                 | do { } while (condition);                                                                       |
| Initialization                  | Declared outside the loop; should be done explicitly before the loop.                 | Declared outside the loop structure                                                             |
| Condition                       | Checked before each iteration.                                                        | Checked after each iteration.                                                                   |
| Update                          | Executed inside the loop; needs to be handled explicitly.                             | Executed inside the loop; needs to be handled explicitly.                                       |
| Use Cases                       | Useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance or based on a condition. | Useful when the loop block must be executed at least once, regardless of the initial condition. |
| Initialization and Update Scope | Scope extends beyond the loop; needs to be handled explicitly.                        | Scope extends beyond the loop; needs to be handled explicitly.                                  |
